##Setup
Please fork and clone this repo.
Run ```bundle```
Run ```rake db:create db:migrate``` to create and migrate database

##Stories to Implement

As a user, I can add the publication date when adding a magazine (spec pending)
As a user, I can edit the the magazine name from the show page (please write the spec for this)

##Bug Fix
There is a bug in the ads for the magazines! All of the ads for the magazine are showing up for the magazine, rather than just the ones that have purchased ad space. This cannot be. Please fix ASAP!
