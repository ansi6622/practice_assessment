##Setup

Please fork and clone this repo.
* Run ```bundle```
* Run ```rake db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare``` to create and migrate database
* Run ```rake db:seed``` to seed the database and make sure you run it in your test environment as well

##Stories to Implement

1. As a user, I can add the publisher when adding a magazine and be able to see that publisher on the show page (spec pending)
2. As a user, I can delete the the magazine. (please write the spec for this)

##Bug Fix
There is a bug in the ads for the magazines! All of the ads for the magazine are showing up for the magazine, rather than just the ones that have purchased ad space. This cannot be. Please fix ASAP!
